14 RULES FOR WRITING MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS 

1. Use Plausible Distractors (wrong-response options) 
• Only list plausible distractors, even if the number of options per question changes 
• Write the options so they are homogeneous in content 
• Use answers given in previous open-ended exams to provide realistic distractors

2. Use a Question Format 
• Experts encourage multiple-choice items to be prepared as questions (rather than incomplete statements) 
Incomplete Statement Format (Less Effective): The capital of California is in ________
Direct Question Format (More Effective): In which of the following cities is the capital of California? 

3. Emphasize Higher-Level Thinking 
• Use memory-plus application questions. These questions require students to recall principles, rules or facts in a real life context. 
• The key to preparing memory-plus application questions is to place the concept in a life situation or context that requires the student to first recall the facts and then apply or transfer the application of those facts into a situation. 
• Seek support from others who have experience writing higher-level thinking multiple-choice questions. 

4. Keep Option Lengths Similar 
• Avoid making your correct answer the long or short answer 

5. Balance the Placement of the Correct Answer 
• Correct answers are usually the second and third option 

6. Be Grammatically Correct 
• Use simple, precise and unambiguous wording 
• Students will be more likely to select the correct answer by finding the grammatically correct option 

7. Avoid Clues to the Correct Answer 
• Avoid answering one question in the test by giving the answer somewhere else in the test 
• Have the test reviewed by someone who can find mistakes, clues, grammar and punctuation problems before you administer the exam to students
• Avoid extremes – never, always, only 
• Avoid nonsense words and unreasonable statements 

8. Avoid Negative Questions 
• 31 of 35 testing experts recommend avoiding negative questions 
• Students may be able to find an incorrect answer without knowing the correct answer 

9. Use Only One Correct Option (Or be sure the best option is clearly the best option) 
• The item should include one and only one correct or clearly best answer 
• With one correct answer, alternatives should be mutually exclusive and not overlapping 
• Using MC with questions containing more than one right answer lowers discrimination between students 

10. Give Clear Instructions 
Questions 1 - 10 are multiple-choice questions designed to assess your ability to remember or recall basic and foundational pieces of knowledge related to this course. Please read each question carefully before reading the answer options. 
Questions 11 – 20 are multiple-choice questions designed to assess your ability to think critically about the subject. Be aware that some questions may seem to have more than one right answer, but you are to look for the one that makes the most sense and is the most correct.

11. Use Only a Single, Clearly-Defined Problem and Include the Main Idea in the Question
• Students must know what the problem is without having to read the response options

12. Avoid the “All the Above” Option 
• Students merely need to recognize two correct options to get the answer correct

13. Avoid the “None of the Above” Option 
• You will never know if students know the correct answer 

14. Don’t Use MC Questions When Other Item Types Are More Appropriate 
• limited distractors or assessing problem-solving and creativity
